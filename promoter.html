                            to the provisions of this paragraph, may amend the Terms and Conditions in its sole
                            discretion and at any time. The most recent version of the Terms and Conditions will be

                            that these notification methods constitute adequate notice to inform the Merchant of any
                            amendments to the Agreement and the Merchant further agrees to be bound by any such
                            amendments to the Agreement upon such notification.</p>

                            code as having been presented and service / goods having been provided.</p>
                        <p>2. Under this Agreement, Hapido is granted authorization to promote and distribute Vouchers
                            on behalf of the Merchant. These Vouchers represent the Merchant's offerings and will be
                            electronically delivered to purchasers upon receipt of payment. Subsequently, purchasers can
                            redeem these Vouchers with the Merchant in either physical or digital format.Hapido's
                            authorization extends to promoting and selling these Vouchers across a variety of platforms,
                            including but not limited to its affiliates, business partner network, marketplace, and
                            referral network. These Vouchers may be made available to Hapido's entire subscriber base or
                            selectively to specific segments based on criteria such as gender, age, location, and
                            consumer preferences. The distribution channels for these features encompass the Internet,
                            the Website, affiliate websites, the business partner network, email, mobile applications,
                            and various other electronic platforms and channels owned or operated by Hapido, its
                            affiliates, or business partners. Furthermore, Hapido has the authority to promote and sell
                            these Vouchers in multiple markets and at times determined at its discretion.</p>
                        <p>3. The actual pricing as outlined in the Deal Appendix by the Merchant, must accurately
                            reflect the selling price of the Merchant Offering for a minimum of 30 days preceding the
                            effective date of the Partnership Deal Appendix and must remain consistent throughout the
                            duration of the deal presented by Hapido. This requirement should be substantiated with a
                            publicly available price list, whether in electronic or printed form, or a screenshot of a
                            price list that is accessible to customers online.The Merchant commits to providing the
                            Merchant Offering without inflating prices or imposing any additional fees, charges,
                            conditions, or restrictions that are contradictory to or inconsistent with the terms
                            specified on the Voucher, including the Deal Highlights & Deal Conditions.</p>
                        <p>4. Hapido provides a marketing service that promotes Merchant Offerings through various
                            channels, including:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Exposure to a broad audience on the Hapido website, apps, and digital platforms</li>
                            <li>Engagement with an established customer database through email and app push
                                notifications.</li>
                            <li>Paid advertising campaigns across various media platforms such as Google, apps, and
                                social media.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>With the exception of fixed-fee campaigns, for most promotional agreements with Merchants,
                            Hapido does not require an upfront fee. Instead, our compensation is solely based on
                            performance, specifically on a per-voucher-sold basis. Given Hapido's substantial investment
                            in marketing our Partner Offerings, it is crucial to safeguard both the authenticity of the
                            offers presented to Hapido customers and our revenue generated through performance-based
                            incentives. In cases where Hapido customers inquire about a Merchant's offerings, the
                            Merchant agrees not to match or offer lower prices directly to purchasers. Furthermore, the
                            Merchant commits not to dissuade potential buyers from purchasing a Hapido voucher. Hapido
                            will regularly conduct market research to ensure that the deals featured on the website
                            genuinely offer discounts to our customers and adhere to the terms of this agreement,
                            emphasizing the importance of directing business through Hapido. If the Merchant is found to
                            be in violation of this provision, an additional monthly marketing fee of AED10,000 will be
                            applied, either deducted from funds held by Hapido or invoiced against future sales.</p>
                        <p>5. Unless explicitly specified in the Deal Highlights or Deal Conditions, the Merchant agrees
                            not to apply different terms or a distinct cancellation policy for Hapido customers compared
                            to their non-Hapido clientele. Any alterations to the terms of the Merchant Offering within
                            3 working days (Monday – Friday) before the confirmed launch date are not permitted unless
                            these changes are more favorable to the Purchaser.</p>
                        <p>Deal Offerings should not conclude at the end of a calendar month or on a Friday, Saturday or
                            Sunday. Once the Deal Offering is active, any requests for modifications to the Merchant
                            Offering must receive approval from Hapido. Such requests should be submitted in writing,
                            accompanied by reasons, and provided with a minimum of 3 working days' notice.</p>
                        <p>The Merchant commits to using the Mobile Redemption Method, with certain agreed-upon
                            exceptions, and undertakes not to request a printed voucher in exchange for services
                            provided. Redemption of vouchers during the promotion period should be conducted using the
                            Merchant Area or Merchant App to mark vouchers as redeemed.</p>
                        <p>If the Merchant needs to conclude a Merchant Offering before the agreed end date, they must
                            notify Hapido with valid reasons, providing a 3 working day notice. The Merchant also agrees
                            to honor vouchers sold in the 3-day period preceding the deal's removal.</p>
                        <p>Hapido reserves the right to assess Merchant response times through various methods,
                            including phone calls, emails, customer feedback, and mystery shopping. If, at its sole
                            discretion, Hapido determines that Merchant response times, value offered, or service
                            quality provided to purchasers are unsatisfactory, Hapido may terminate the Agreement and
                            refund the Amount Paid to Purchasers for unredeemed Vouchers.</p>
                        <p>The Merchant must honor Vouchers for the Merchant Offering until the Voucher Expiration Date.
                            In the event of any changes affecting this agreement or the live Merchant Offering, such as
                            product or service unavailability, business closure, or force majeure circumstances, the
                            Merchant must promptly notify Hapido via email.</p>
                        <p>Regarding partial redemptions, if applicable, and if a purchaser redeems a Voucher for less
                            than the Amount Paid, the Merchant is responsible for handling any unredeemed value in
                            accordance with applicable laws. The Merchant agrees that as long as an appointment or
                            reservation is made to redeem a Voucher or the purchaser attempts to make an appointment
                            before the Voucher Expiration Date, the Voucher will be honored for the Full Offer Value
                            without restrictions, even if the services are provided after the Voucher Expiration Date.
                        </p>
                        <p>The Merchant assumes responsibility for all customer service related to the Merchant Offering
                            and for supplying all goods and services as described in the Merchant Offering. Any customer
                            loyalty programs associated with the Merchant Offering are also the Merchant's
                            responsibility. If applicable, the Merchant should have the Merchant Offering available for
                            pickup by purchasers at the Redemption Site, which is the accurate address provided to
                            Hapido for Voucher redemption. The Merchant agrees to furnish Hapido with operating hours,
                            dates of operation (including exceptions), and a valid phone number for the Redemption Site.
                            If any information pertaining to a Redemption Site changes, the Merchant agrees to promptly
                            inform Hapido of such changes.</p>
                        <p>Hapido retains the ongoing right to reject, revise, or discontinue any Merchant Offering at
                            its discretion and for any reason. Hapido may also terminate the Merchant Offering, remove
                            all references to it and the Voucher from the Website, and redirect or delete any associated
                            URLs.</p>
                        <p>6. If relevant, the Merchant commits not to showcase a duplicate of the Deal Offering on the
                            Website and App or on comparable deal platforms, internally, or through any other sales
                            channel concurrently, unless mutually agreed upon in advance by both parties. If the
                            Merchant violates this exclusivity agreement, Hapido retains the authority to temporarily
                            suspend the Merchant Offering until a thorough investigation and resolution of the matter
                            have been completed.</p>
                        <p>7. Hapido will continue to secure the necessary licenses to promote Merchant Offerings on the
                            Website, where such licenses are available from the Dubai Economic Department. If the
                            Merchant and/or the Merchant Offering necessitates a specific approval, license, or
                            permission from the relevant local authority, any associated fees must be settled by the
                            Merchant before launching the Merchant Offering. Additionally, the permit number must be
                            shared with Hapido. It is the sole responsibility of the Merchant to provide this
                            information and adhere to the legal processes in accordance with UAE laws and all
                            governmental regulations. Any penalties imposed by the relevant authority will be the
                            responsibility of the Merchant, with no liability on the part of Hapido or Hapido Portal
                            LLC.</p>
                        <p>8. The funds retained by Hapido from the proceeds of the Merchant Offering serve as
                            compensation for various services, including marketing the Merchant Offering to Hapido's
                            existing customer database, external promotion and advertising of the Merchant Offering, and
                            the distribution of Vouchers on behalf of the Merchant. Hapido will collect the Voucher
                            Price, as detailed in the Deal Appendix, from the sale of each Merchant Offering. From the
                            total amount collected from Purchasers (referred to as "Proceeds"), Hapido will deduct the
                            Commission Payment, specified as a percentage in the Deal Appendix, any legally applicable
                            VAT associated with the Commission, and the remainder retained for potential refunds.
                            The Merchant's compensation will be in accordance with the details outlined in the Merchant
                            Agreement, specifically under the Agreement Term clause. It is the Merchant's responsibility
                            to maintain the Merchant Area, marking all redeemed Vouchers within the Vouchers' expiration
                            period.</p>
                        <p>Upon the final settlement of a deal, the balance of Proceeds due for redeemed Vouchers is
                            disbursed to the Merchant in accordance with the Payment Terms. Vouchers presented for
                            redemption after their expiration date will not be considered valid. Hapido retains the
                            right to issue refunds to Customers who, in Hapido's reasonable judgment, have a valid
                            complaint regarding the Merchant's services, which may include factors such as
                            unsatisfactory service, unavailability of goods or services, temporary or permanent business
                            closure, and so forth.</p>
                        <p>If the total refund amount exceeds the balance retained by the Merchant, the Merchant must
                            transfer the excess amount to Hapido or provide a cheque to Hapido within 7 business days of
                            receiving notice from Hapido. The Merchant acknowledges that the amounts received from
                            Hapido constitute full payment for all services delivered by the Merchant as part of the
                            Merchant Offering.</p>
                        <p>The Merchant is solely responsible for complying with any contractual requirements stipulated
                            in its agreements with Third-Party Suppliers, which may include obligations related to
                            offering discounted services. Notwithstanding any other provisions, Hapido is not obligated
                            to advance funds paid by a purchaser until the Merchant has fulfilled its obligations under
                            this Agreement. If Hapido reasonably believes that the Merchant has breached any terms of
                            this Agreement, Hapido may, at its sole discretion, withhold, delay, or offset future
                            payments to the Merchant. Furthermore, if the Merchant is unwilling or, in Hapido's
                            reasonable judgment, unable to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement, Hapido is
                            authorized to withhold, delay, or offset future payments, in addition to pursuing other
                            remedies available under this Agreement or under the law, to recover any refunds or other
                            amounts owed by the Merchant under this Agreement. Hapido is authorized to make payments via
                            bank transfer to the bank account specified in the Deal Appendix. In cases where the payee's
                            name does not match the business or owner's name as per the trade license, an NOC ("No
                            Objection Certificate") letter, duly filled, signed, and stamped with the Merchant's company
                            stamp, must be provided as an Appendix to the Partnership Agreement.</p>
                        <p>The Merchant is responsible for covering any additional charges associated with the
                            implementation of this Agreement, including but not limited to bank fees, exchange rate
                            differences, government-related administrative costs, and legal expenses. To streamline bank
                            transfer costs, all international payments will be subject to a minimum of AED 10,000 or
                            equivalent in other currency. Any payments made by Hapido to the Merchant will not affect
                            any claims or rights that Hapido may have against the Merchant. The Merchant acknowledges
                            that the amounts received from Hapido constitute full payment for all services provided by
                            the Merchant as part of the Merchant Offering.</p>
                        <p>9. The Merchant is responsible for determining whether any taxes are applicable to the
                            payments it makes or receives and for ensuring the correct collection, reporting, and
                            remittance of these taxes to the relevant tax authority. Hapido does not assume
                            responsibility for determining the tax obligations associated with the Merchant's
                            transactions involving purchasers or Hapido, nor does it undertake the collection,
                            reporting, or remittance of any taxes arising from such transactions between the Merchant
                            and purchasers.</p>
                        <p>Hapido will issue a VAT invoice for the Commission in compliance with applicable laws. The
                            Merchant should also provide purchasers with invoices as required by applicable law. The
                            Merchant is solely responsible for any Value Added Tax (VAT) related to all sales resulting
                            from transactions covered by this Agreement between Hapido and the Merchant. Hapido will
                            apply the applicable VAT to the Commission and/or other fees retained by Hapido as
                            stipulated in this agreement. The VAT amount will be calculated at the time of each payment
                            based on the prevailing rates under the prevailing law.
                            The Merchant may be asked to furnish Hapido with a valid Tax Identification Number for tax
                            reporting purposes. Regardless of any other provisions in this Agreement, the Merchant must
                            be and remain registered for sales, use, and similar tax collection purposes in all states,
                            countries, and localities where such registration is required in connection with the
                            Merchant Offering and pursuant to the terms and redemption of the Voucher. Additionally, the
                            Merchant is responsible for paying any and all sales, use, or other taxes associated with
                            the Merchant Offering or the goods and services offered.</p>
                        <p>10. The term "Customer Data" encompasses all identifiable information pertaining to
                            purchasers that is generated or collected by either Hapido or the Merchant. This information
                            includes, but is not limited to, purchasers' names, addresses, email addresses, phone
                            numbers, purchaser preferences, and financial transaction details. The Merchant is permitted
                            to utilize Customer Data solely for the purpose of fulfilling its redemption obligations
                            related to the Merchant Offering, as explicitly authorized by this Agreement.</p>
                        <p>The Merchant explicitly agrees that any Customer Data shall be used exclusively for this
                            authorized purpose, including the redemption of Vouchers and the provision of goods and
                            services to purchasers. It shall not be used to enrich any list or database owned by the
                            Merchant or any third party. The Merchant affirms, assures, and commits that it will not
                            sell, mediate, or disclose any portion or entirety of Customer Data to any third party for
                            any reason, unless compelled by applicable law.</p>
                        <p>Should the Merchant enlist the services of a third party to facilitate its redemption
                            obligations under this Agreement, the Merchant must ensure that such third party implements
                            and complies with reasonable security measures when handling Customer Data. If Customer Data
                            is collected directly by the Merchant or a third party engaged by the Merchant for the
                            purpose of fulfilling its redemption obligations, the Merchant must ensure that it or the
                            third party adheres to its published privacy policy and all relevant laws governing the
                            processing of Customer Data.</p>
                        <p>The limitations on the Merchant's use of Customer Data, as outlined in this Agreement, do not
                            apply to the following circumstances:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Data obtained from a purchaser who was already a customer of the Merchant before the
                                Effective Date, provided such data was shared with the Merchant by the purchaser
                                independently of this Agreement or any transaction herein.</li>
                            <li>Data provided by a purchaser directly to the Merchant, who subsequently becomes a
                                customer of the Merchant, expressly opting in to receive communications from the
                                Merchant.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The Merchant is obligated to promptly inform Hapido if it becomes aware of or suspects any
                            unauthorized access to or utilization of Customer Data or any confidential information
                            belonging to Hapido. The Merchant shall cooperate with Hapido in investigating such breaches
                            and mitigating any resultant damages. The Merchant will cover all expenses incurred by
                            Hapido in complying with applicable laws (including data breach laws) or arising from
                            unauthorized access or acquisition of Customer Data while such data is reasonably within the
                            possession or control of the Merchant.
                            Upon the termination or expiration of this Agreement, the Merchant must, as per Hapido's
                            instructions, either destroy or return to Hapido all Customer Data that is in the Merchant's
                            possession or in the possession of any agent acting on behalf of the Merchant.</p>
                        <p>11. This Agreement will remain in effect until it is terminated by either party as outlined
                            in this Section ("Term"). Hapido has the authority to terminate this Agreement at any time
                            and for any reason by providing written notice to the Merchant. Likewise, the Merchant has
                            the authority to terminate this Agreement by providing written notice to Hapido at least
                            thirty (30) business days in advance.</p>
                        <p>The termination of this Agreement will not relieve the Merchant of its responsibility to
                            honor any Voucher in accordance with the terms specified in this Agreement, including the
                            obligation to accept the Voucher for the Amount Paid even after the Voucher Expiration Date
                            has passed. Any provisions within this Agreement that are intended to endure beyond its
                            termination will remain fully effective and enforceable.</p>
                        <p>12. The Merchant grants Hapido a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, fully paid-up,
                            perpetual, irrevocable, transferable, and sublicensable license and right to use, modify,
                            reproduce, sublicense, publicly display, distribute, broadcast, transmit, stream, publish,
                            and publicly perform the following:</p>
                        <p>a) The Merchant's name, logos, trademarks, service marks, domain names, and any content such

                                ("Hapido IP")</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The Merchant is prohibited from utilizing, selling, renting, leasing, sublicensing,
                            distributing, broadcasting, transmitting, streaming, transferring, copying, reproducing,

                            reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the Hapido IP. The Merchant shall not take any
                            action challenging the validity of Hapido's rights in the Hapido IP or Hapido's ownership or
                            registration thereof.</p>
                        <p>Unless expressly provided in this Agreement, neither the Merchant nor any third party
                            assisting the Merchant with its obligations under this Agreement is permitted to use Hapido
                            IP in any medium without prior written approval from an authorized Hapido representative.
                            The Merchant shall not include any trade names, trademarks, service marks, domain names,
                            email addresses, social network identifiers, or any variants or misspellings thereof
                            belonging to Hapido or its affiliates in any trademark, domain name, metadata, email
                            address, or search engine keyword.</p>
                        <p>The Merchant is prohibited from using or displaying any Hapido IP in a manner that could
                            reasonably imply an endorsement, relationship, affiliation, or sponsorship between the
                            Merchant or a third party and Hapido.</p>
                        <p>All rights to the Hapido IP that are not explicitly granted in this Agreement are reserved by
                            Hapido.</p>
                        <p>In the event that the Merchant provides Hapido or any of its affiliates with feedback,
                            suggestions, reviews, modifications, data, images, text, or other information or content
                            related to a Hapido product or service or in connection with this Agreement, any Hapido IP,
                            or the Merchant's participation in the Merchant Offering or Voucher (collectively referred
                            to as "Feedback"), the Merchant hereby assigns all rights, titles, and interests in and to
                            the Feedback to Hapido in an irrevocable manner. If the assignment of Feedback to Hapido is
                            deemed invalid for any reason, the Merchant grants Hapido and its affiliates an irrevocable,
                            perpetual, paid-up, royalty-free, non-exclusive, worldwide, freely transferable right and
                            license to:
                            <br>i) Use, reproduce, perform, display, and distribute Feedback.
                            <br>ii) Adapt, modify, reformat, and create derivative works based on Feedback for any
                            purpose, and sublicense these rights to other individuals or entities.
                        </p>
                        <p>The Merchant represents and warrants that:
                            <br> A) Feedback is the original work of the Merchant or was lawfully obtained.
                            <br> B) The exercise of rights by Hapido and its sublicensees under the license provided
                            above will not violate the rights of any person or entity, including copyright rights.
                            <br> The Merchant also agrees to assist Hapido in documenting, perfecting, or maintaining
                            Hapido's rights in and to Feedback as needed.
                        </p>
                        <p>13. The Merchant affirms and guarantees that:</p>
                        <p>a) The Merchant possesses the rightful authority, capability, and authorization to engage in
                            this Agreement.
                            <br> b) As necessitated by applicable laws, the Merchant is duly registered for sales and
                            tax collection purposes in all jurisdictions where the Merchant will provide goods and
                            services.
                            <br> c) Upon Hapido's delivery, the Voucher will be promptly available for redemption, and
                            the Merchant will have an adequate supply of goods and/or services accessible for redemption
                            until the Voucher Expiration Date.
                            <br> d) The terms and conditions specified in the Voucher, including any discounts or goods
                            and services offered, do not and will not contravene any local, state, provincial,
                            territorial, or federal law, statute, regulation, rule, or order. This includes, but is not
                            limited to, laws or regulations pertaining to the sale and distribution of alcohol,

                            <br> e) The redemption of the Voucher by the Merchant will result in the genuine provision
                            of goods and/or services to the purchaser.
                            <br> f) The Merchant has full ownership of the Merchant IP and holds the necessary licensing
                            rights (with the ability to sublicense to Hapido) for the Third Party IP. Furthermore, the
                            Merchant possesses the authority to grant the License as detailed in this Agreement.
                            <br> g) The Merchant IP, Third Party IP, the Merchant Offering, Hapido's utilization and
                            promotion thereof, and the outcomes resulting from such Merchant Offerings will not
                            infringe, diminish, misappropriate, or otherwise violate any intellectual property rights,
                            privacy rights, or publicity rights of any third party, or any applicable laws worldwide.
                            This also includes not resulting from the misappropriation of any trade secret or the breach
                            of any confidentiality obligations to any individual or entity.

                            menacing, abusive, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, profane, or otherwise objectionable, nor do
                            they encourage actions constituting criminal offenses or civil liability or violate any
                            laws.
                            <br> i) The Vouchers and any advertising or promotion related to the Merchant's goods and
                            services will not constitute false, deceptive, unfair advertising, or disparagement under
                            any applicable law.
                            <br> j) The Merchant and its employees, contractors, and agents have received appropriate
                            education and training and possess all necessary and current regulatory authorizations,

                            services as described in this Agreement.
                            <br> k) The business information and direct deposit details provided in this Agreement,
                            specifying where payments should be remitted, are accurate, and the Merchant is the
                            authorized entity to receive funds forwarded by Hapido.
                            <br> l) The Merchant is not authorized to resell, broker, or otherwise disclose any Customer
                            Data (as defined in this Agreement) to any third party, either in its entirety or in part,
                            for any purpose. The Merchant is solely authorized to copy or reproduce Customer Data for
                            the sole purpose of redeeming or verifying the validity of Vouchers in connection with this
                            Agreement.
                            <br> m) The Merchant Offering satisfies the following criteria: (i) devoid of defects in

                        </p>
                        <p>14. To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Merchant agrees to protect, indemnify, and
                            hold Hapido, its affiliated and related entities, and all of its respective officers,
                            directors, agents, and employees harmless from and against any claims, lawsuits,

                            <br> a) Any breach or alleged breach of this Agreement by the Merchant or the
                            representations and warranties made within this Agreement.
                            <br> b) Any claim related to state sales, use, or similar tax obligations of the Merchant
                            that arise from the sale and redemption of a Voucher.
                            <br> c) Any claim made by a local, state, provincial, territorial, or federal governmental
                            entity for unredeemed Vouchers, unredeemed cash values of Vouchers, or any other amounts in
                            accordance with applicable abandoned or unclaimed property or escheat laws. This includes
                            claims for penalties and interest.
                            <br> d) Any claim stemming from a violation of any law or regulation by the Merchant
                            governing the Merchant's goods and/or services.

                            <br> i) Any claim arising from the Merchant's negligence, fraud, or willful misconduct.
                            <br> Hapido retains the right to oversee its own defense and to select and appoint its own
                            defense counsel, regardless of the presence or absence of any conflict of interest between
                            Hapido and the Merchant. The Merchant's obligation to defend and indemnify Hapido
                            encompasses the responsibility to cover Hapido's reasonable attorneys' fees and costs,
                            including any fees for experts.
                        </p>

                        <p>15. The details pertaining to the Merchant Offering outlined in this Agreement are considered
                            confidential, and the Merchant commits to not divulge these details to any third party.
                            However, this restriction does not apply to disclosures made to the Merchant's employees,
                            parent companies, shareholders, legal counsel, and accountants when such disclosures are
                            strictly necessary. Additionally, disclosures required by applicable public records or other
                            laws are exempted, provided that the Merchant has implemented customary measures to
                            safeguard the confidentiality of the disclosed information.
                            <br> In the event of a breach of this confidentiality agreement, Hapido reserves the right
                            to seek injunctive relief, specific performance, and any other remedies available under
                            applicable law, including the possibility of pursuing monetary damages if deemed
                            appropriate.
                        </p>
                        <p>16. Except for the Merchant's indemnification obligations as outlined in this Agreement,
                            neither party shall be held liable or obligated to the other party or any third party for
                            any of the following, regardless of the form of action (be it in contract, tort, or
                            otherwise), and even if they were informed of the possibility of such damages in advance:
                            lost profits, lost business, special, incidental, exemplary, consequential, punitive, or
                            indirect damages.
                            <br> Hapido's sole and complete liability to the Merchant concerning any claims arising from
                            or related to this Agreement, or any errors, omissions, or misplacements of any Voucher, is
                            limited to the amount of fees retained by Hapido under this Agreement for the preceding six
                            (6) months following the final calculation and reconciliation of all refunds. This
                            limitation of liability applies to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law and
                            remains in force even if any limited remedy fails.
                            <br> Furthermore, any claim made by or on behalf of the Merchant regarding any payment made
                            by Hapido, including claims asserting that the Merchant received insufficient payment, must
                            be submitted in writing to Hapido within sixty (60) days from the date Hapido remits the
                            disputed payment. Failure to adhere to this procedure will result in the claim being
                            considered waived, released, and discharged by the Merchant.
                        </p>
                        <p>17. Any dispute that arises in relation to this contract, including any issues concerning its
                            existence, validity, or termination, shall be exclusively subject to the jurisdiction of the
                            Courts of the Dubai International Financial Centre. This contract will be governed by and

                        <p>18. The parties involved are regarded as independent contractors, and nothing within this
                            Agreement is intended to establish a joint venture, partnership, franchise, or agency
                            relationship between them. Neither party possesses the authority to bind or obligate the
                            other party in any manner without prior written consent.
                            <br> This Agreement represents the complete agreement between the
                            parties regarding its subject matter, superseding all previous oral or written agreements
                            pertaining to the same subject matter. The Merchant is not authorized to transfer or assign
                            its rights or obligations under this Agreement, whether through operation of law or
                            otherwise, without obtaining prior written consent from Hapido. Any waivers must be
                            documented in writing and signed by an authorized representative of Hapido.
                            <br> Hapido has the authorization to transfer or assign this Agreement to a present or
                            future affiliate, or as part of a merger, consolidation, reorganization, sale of assets or
                            business, or by operation of law, without requiring notice to the Merchant.
                            <br> Should any provision of this Agreement be deemed invalid or unenforceable, the
                            remaining provisions of this Agreement will remain valid and enforceable without any impact.
                        </p>
                        <p>19. Neither party shall be held accountable for any inability or delay in fulfilling its
                            obligations under this Agreement due to circumstances beyond its reasonable control,
                            including but not limited to acts of God, accidents, riots, war, terrorist acts, epidemics,
                            pandemics, quarantine, civil unrest, communication facility breakdowns, web host or internet

                            in laws or regulations, national strikes, fires, explosions, widespread unavailability of
                            raw materials or energy. It is important to note that Force Majeure does not encompass (a)
                            financial distress or either party's inability to generate profit or prevent financial loss,
                            (b) alterations in market prices or conditions, or (c) a party's financial incapability to
                            fulfill its obligations under this Agreement.</p>
                        <p>This Agreement contains no express or implied representations or warranties, including but
                            not limited to any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a specific purpose, or
