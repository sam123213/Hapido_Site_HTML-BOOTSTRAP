                        <p>Please read these Terms and Conditions carefully as you must acknowledge that you accept the
                            terms of sale before making any purchases via Hapido. Nonetheless, these terms elucidate how
                            we conduct our business, the services we provide, and the expectations we have of you in
                            return. They come into effect when you make a purchase or have already done so through our
                            platform. When you purchase via us, strictly speaking, it's not directly from our entity.
                            Rather, it's from the museum, cultural landmark, amusement park, or tour operator offering
                            tickets via our platform. They are the true providers of your tickets.
                            Our platform offers various products, each subject to specific terms and conditions
                            mentioned in the product description, supplementing these general terms and conditions.</p>

                            due to your use of their website/APP. Regardless of the nature of the claim, Hapido
                            liability to you will always be limited to your discontinuation of the use of their

                        <p>Should you possess a valid promotion code, you can apply it during checkout to benefit from
                            the relevant offer. Any applicable promotional discount will be subtracted directly from the
                            final amount you're required to pay. The terms and conditions of individual offers regulate
                            these promotions, and Hapido retains the authority to cancel orders that breach these terms.
                            Customers repeatedly misusing promotion terms may, at the company's discretion, have their
                            accounts blocked, thereby preventing further reservations on the Hapido platform.</p>

                        <p>Instant confirmation applies to certain Services. For others, the indicated time for
                            confirmation on the Hapido Platform serves as a reference; actual confirmation duration
                            might differ</p>

                        <h5 class="mt-4">Purchase and Use of Vouchers</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>You can buy vouchers for various Services from Hapido through their platform. These
                                vouchers are for Services offered by Operators in different destinations.</li>
                            <li>Upon purchase, you'll receive an email confirming your purchase, containing a Voucher
                                confirmation number and a printable version of your Voucher.</li>
                            <li>To use the Voucher, you must arrive on time at the Operator's designated meeting point
                                and present the necessary documents/information, which might include the Confirmation
                                Number or a printed version of your Voucher. Failure to do so results in no refunds.
                            </li>
                            <li>The Operator might require a photo-bearing identification document for Voucher usage.
                                Lost, destroyed, or stolen Vouchers/Confirmation Numbers aren't the responsibility of
                                Hapido or the Operator.</li>
                            <li>Vouchers become void if the Services they're meant for are prohibited by law. Using a
                                Voucher unlawfully can lead to the Operator refusing the Voucher, with no refunds
                                granted.</li>
                        </ul>

                                deemed to violate their policy. This determination is solely at the discretion of
                                Hapido.</li>
                            <li>Hapido aims to present or arrange Services through Operators at the most competitive
                                market price. However, it's clarified that any taxes or additional fees specific to
                                certain Services are not factored into determining the best price.</li>
                            <li>Although Operators are obligated to furnish Hapido with accurate and updated Service
                                prices on the Hapido Platform, Hapido cannot ensure that all Service prices provided by
                                Operators are consistently accurate and updated.</li>
                        </ul>
